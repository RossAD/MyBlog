So I began building my public facing personal webpage using Gatsby Static
Website generator (https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby).  I have found it to be
quite fun to use so far, especially with the amount complexity that has been
extracted to the background.  This allows me to quickly and easily create blog
posts that are then quickly formatted into a nice readable format on my blog.
Stay tuned for more on my fiddlings with Gatsby.
